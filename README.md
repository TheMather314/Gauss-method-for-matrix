# Gauss-method-for-linear-equations
A simple algorithm to get the triangular matrix.
Maybe there are still some bugs.
Use:
1. You have to write the dimensions of the matrix. For example: 3 4
2. You have to write the diferent rows. For example:
3 2 5 4 (press Enter)
9 4 3 2 (press Enter)
0 9.4 2 (press Enter)
